# some of most important concepts in Machine Learning

1. How would you define Machine Learning?

> Machine Learning is about building systems that can learn from data. Learning means getting better at some task, given some performance measure.
>

2. Can you name four types of problems where it shines?

> Machine Learning is great for complex problems for which we have no algorithmic solution, to replace long lists of hand-tuned rules, to build systems that adapt to fluctuating environments, and finally to help humans learn (e.g., data mining).
>

3. What is a labeled trained set?

> A labeled training set is a training set that contains the desired solution (a.k.a. a label) for each instance.
>

4. What are the two most common supervised tasks?

> The two most common supervised tasks are regression and classification.
>

5. Can you name four common unsupervised tasks?

> Common unsupervised tasks include clustering, visualization, dimensionality reduction, and association rule learning.
>

6. What type of Machine Learning algorithm would you use to allow a robot to walk in various unknown terrains?

> Reinforcement Learning is likely to perform best if we want a robot to learn to walk in various unknown terrains since this is typically the type of problem that Reinforcement Learning tackles. It might be possible to express the problem as a supervised or semi-supervised learning problem, but it would be less natural.
